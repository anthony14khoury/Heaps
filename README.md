Data Structures Mini Project #1!

This solution includes inserting into and deleting from a heap. My removal function deals with the rotations to keep the heap proper.
I will soon update the insert function to auto rotate the heap to keep it proper as well.

You can enter up to 10 numbers (or change the array size if you want to insert more). Inserting -1 as you input values cancels the cin and then the program will remove the root.
